    <h1>Introduction to Version Control</h1>
    <p>In this module, we will explore the fundamental concept of version control and its crucial role in managing and organizing code for web applications. Whether you’re a beginner or have some experience in web development, understanding version control is essential for working effectively and collaboratively on web projects.</p>
<h2>What is Version Control?</h2>
<p>Version control is like having a time machine for your code. It allows you to keep track of changes you make to your website and easily go back to previous versions if something goes wrong.</p>
<h3>Practical example of the use of Git</h3>

<p>Imagine you’re a student working on an important thesis using a Word document. You’ve put in countless hours of research, writing, and refining your content.

    Now, it’s time to share your work with your lecturer for feedback and revisions. Without any version control system in place, this process can quickly become chaotic and challenging.
    
    Picture this:</p>

<p>ou send your initial draft to the lecturer, who then makes suggestions and comments directly on the document. You receive the document back with the changes, but it’s challenging to track what has been modified, which sections have been revised, and which comments need your attention.

    As you start incorporating the feedback and making changes, the document becomes cluttered, making it difficult to navigate and understand the progression of your work.
    
    Now, let’s introduce version control, specifically Git, into this scenario.</p>
